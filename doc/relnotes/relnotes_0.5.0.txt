  (q) Improved processing speed in processing to keep symmetry of a state covariance matrix
  (r) Added processing to initialize the state vector and its error covariance 
      if the difference between ppprtk and point positioning(single) solutions exceeds 
      a threshold value (pos2-rejdiffpse)
  (s) Added processing to initialize the state vector and its error covariance 
      if integer ambiguities are not obtained over predefined consecutive epochs
      (misc-retrycnt, misc-epochtoretry)
  (t) Added processing for single grid selection mode in PPP-RTK positioing calculation
      if the distance between nearest gird and point positioning(single) is close.
